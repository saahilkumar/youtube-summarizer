# Summarizer

Summarizer is a useful web application that was created with React.JS at IvyHacks 2020. It's an educational tool that allows students to get quick summaries of any Youtube video or piece of text. It can be used to summarize lectures, tutorials, news reports, debates, and much more.

Summarizer uses two different artificial intelligence methods to generate two summaries of the inputted media. Both of these summaries are made available to the user to help them get a better understanding of what concepts were most important in the video or text that they submitted.

Summarizer also uses AI to rate the overall sentiment of the media. This feature is especially helpful when summarizing things such as news articles, short films, or debates.
